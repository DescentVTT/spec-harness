/**
 * Minutes each file took in a full mutation sweep, read off the sweep's log.
 *
 * Stryker's reports carry no timings, but its progress reporter prints a
 * timestamped "n/total tested" line every ten seconds, and the order it tests
 * mutants in is fixed: mutants without coverage first, then every other mutant
 * file by file, alphabetically, with static mutants moved to the end (they need
 * the test environment reloaded, and Stryker sorts those last), again file by
 * file. So each file owns a known stretch of the count, and the log says when
 * that stretch began and ended.
 *
 * The order is an inference from Stryker's source, so the output checks it: the
 * timeouts the log counted inside each file's stretch should match the timeouts
 * the report gives that file, give or take a mutant or two where four workers
 * overlap a boundary. If they do not, the order has changed and the minutes mean
 * nothing. On the full sweep of eb39599 they matched within three for every
 * file.
 *
 * Works on one shard's log and report as well as on a whole sweep's.
 *
 * A static mutant runs every test file, one after another, until a test fails,
 * so its minutes are the files that ran before the one that killed it. The last
 * columns count, of each file's static mutants, those killed only after another
 * test file had run to its end, those that survived and those that timed out:
 * the three that wait for more than one file, and where the static minutes of
 * a sweep are (ADR-0010, amended 2026-10-09).
 *
 *   gh run view <run> --job <job> --log > sweep.log

 * from spec-core, @descent-vtt/spec-graph and @descent-vtt/spec-guard.
