/**
 * The merge that turns the shards of the full mutation sweep back into one
 * score (scripts/mutation-shards.mjs).
 *
 * The merge is the gate, so the property worth holding is that it cannot score
 * anything but exactly one sweep: a report split into shards the way Stryker
 * would write them must merge back to the same verdicts, tests and score, and
 * each way of not being one sweep must be refused rather than scored. The
 * tests are spec-core's, spec-graph's and spec-guard's, where each of 24
 * defects put into the merge one at a time made them fail. This file reads the
 * disk and spawns node, so it is not in the unit suite; the full sweep leaves
 * it out (vitest.mutation.config.ts).
 *
 * The order the sweep runs a mutant's test files in is held here too: it is
 * the sweep's, and no mutant is under it. So is which changes the sweep runs
 * for: the paths the workflow names, against what each sweep mutates, so that
 * no module of src/ is left between the two, and against the tests and the
 * vendored copy its verdicts are made of. And so is what both sweeps report,
 * as vitest resolves it from their two suites.
