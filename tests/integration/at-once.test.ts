/**
 * What a command asks at once, and what it reads once.
 *
 * A process is what a command's time is made of: on a Windows workstation
 * git answers in a few hundred milliseconds and Claude Code in seconds, so
 * what `doctor`, `init` and the hook take is how many of them wait on one
 * another. Nothing a command prints says which did, so these tests read the
 * order the processes were started and answered in, through a mock of
 * `execFile` that hands every call on as it was given. No test here reads a
 * clock: where one thing has to be shown started before another has
 * answered, the mock keeps the answer back until it is.
 *
 * The same for a matcher that is a pattern, read in a context of its own:
 * the readings are counted through a mock of `runInNewContext`.
 *
 * A file of its own, because a mock reaches everything the file imports.
