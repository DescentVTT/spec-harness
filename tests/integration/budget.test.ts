/**
 * One budget for a run of Claude Code's hook, every process it starts
 * together (ADR-0002, amended 2026-10-24). Each process asked a question
 * had 20 seconds, and several that answered slowly, none of them at that,
 * passed the 60 seconds Claude Code gives the hook's entry as init writes
 * it, which cancels the hook and lets the write go ahead. This file
 * shortens the budget to three seconds, so that a run that passes it is
 * read in seconds; the rest of the suite runs at the budget itself.
