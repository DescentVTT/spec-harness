/**
 * A configuration that does not load, and the one write it lets through
 * (ADR-0005, amended 2026-10-19).
 *
 * Every write was held while `.spec-harness.json` did not load, the one
 * that mends it among them, so a session could not mend a typo in it. A
 * write to that file itself, and to nothing else, now goes on with the line
 * that says why every other write is held. What a write names is read as
 * the hook reads a path to decide it, and as the disk reads it to write: a
 * path that only reads like the file, a link to it, a second name of it and
 * a file of another work tree are each held as before.
