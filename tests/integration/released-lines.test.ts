/**
 * The command lines the releases put into people's repositories.
 *
 * `init` writes the guard hooks into `.claude/settings.json`, the server
 * into `.mcp.json` and git's pre-commit hook, and never writes one of them
 * again: a repository keeps the line the release it ran wrote. The plugin
 * ships the same hooks and server. So each line any release wrote is one a
 * later release is still handed, argument for argument, and a release that
 * refuses what an earlier one accepted is held to them here: none may be
 * refused, and Claude Code's hook least of all, since exit 2 from it holds
 * every write of a session (ADR-0005, ADR-0012).
 *
 * The lines are data, read from the tags: `src/setup.ts`, `src/configure.ts`,
 * `hooks/hooks.json` and `.mcp.json` at v0.1.0 to v0.21.0. A line is added
 * here when a release changes what it writes, and none is taken out: 0.22.0
 * names the script under the scope the family moved to on 2026-10-26, so the
 * lines with the earlier scope's stay, beside those it writes.
