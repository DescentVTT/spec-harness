/**
 * Did the round stay inside the lines?
 *
 * One report, from three sources and one question of its own:
 *
 * - spec-brief's archive, asked with `--dry-run`: open boxes, protected files
 *   changed, files outside the scope, a tree that was not committed. The
 *   archive is spec-brief's decision, so its reasons are carried as they are
 *   - one defect, one finding - and the harness does not measure the scope a
 *   second time.
 * - spec-guard, over the brief's own assertions: the goals must hold now. A
 *   premise - an assertion in a section that states what was true before the
 *   round, such as "The Defect, Measured" - is expected to stop holding, and
 *   one that still holds says the defect may still be there.
 * - The rulings: each one whose signature does not verify is reported, since
 *   an unverified ruling allows nothing.
 * - And the one question nobody else asks: which dependencies the round
 *   added. A dependency is code no reviewer read.
 *
 * A part that could not be measured is a finding, never a silence, and what
 * was measured is reported beside what was found: an audit that finds nothing
 * because it checked nothing must not read as one that checked and found
 * nothing (spec-core ADR-0005).
