/**
 * `spec-harness init`: the family configured to agree, from the first day.
 *
 * The integration faults found when the tools were first run together were all
 * configuration: spec-graph read an archived brief as a retired decision and
 * reported every brief that depended on one; spec-guard executed an archived
 * brief's assertions. Each tool can be told the truth; `init` tells each of
 * them the same truth, derived from spec-brief's own settings.
 *
 * It prints a plan and changes nothing until `--write`. It merges into files
 * that exist and never replaces what a person wrote; a git hook the
 * repository already has is left alone, with the line to add printed instead.
