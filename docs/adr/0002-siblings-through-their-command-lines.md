# ADR-0002: Siblings through their command lines

## Context

spec-harness needs spec-brief's view of the briefs, spec-guard's rules and
assertions, and spec-graph's view of the documents. It could import their
packages, or run their command lines and read the versioned JSON they
already print.

## Decision

**Command lines and versioned JSON, never imports** (spec-core ADR-0005).

- A sibling is found as the repository installed it,
  `node_modules/@descent-vtt/<tool>/bin/<tool>.js`, run with the current
  Node - or as `tools` in `.spec-harness.json` names it. Never through a
  shell: a brief id or a path is an argument, not syntax.
- A JSON document is read only at a `schemaVersion` this release knows. An
  unknown version, a document of the wrong shape, or exit 2 from a sibling is
  exit 2 here: the answer rests on something that cannot be read.
- **A missing sibling is reported, never assumed clean.** `audit` without
  spec-guard says the assertions were not run; `context` without spec-guard
  says the rules could not be read. Only spec-brief is required, because the
  brief is the contract and spec-brief is its reader.

## Consequences

Each tool is released, pinned and dropped on its own, and the harness adds no
dependency to any of them. The cost is a process per question: roughly 100 ms
on Linux and several hundred on a Windows workstation with real-time
scanning. The guard hook asks spec-brief only when a brief is named, once per
tool call.
