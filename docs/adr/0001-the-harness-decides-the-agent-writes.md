# ADR-0001: The harness decides; the agent writes

## Context

The plan this tool grew from (`agent-brief-harness`, 2026-09-13) had it
package context, run agents as subprocesses, watch their output streams,
count their tokens, roll back their work and draft ADRs. Several of those are
a model's work - writing an ADR, deciding what a goal means - and several are
work the agent's own host already does better - running the agent, counting
its tokens. A tool that does the model's part gives a different answer each
time; one that duplicates the host's part is always a version behind it.

## Decision

**spec-harness never calls a model and never writes content.** It gives the
agent what it needs and judges what the agent did, deterministically:

| It does | It does not |
| --- | --- |
| assemble a round's context (`context`) | summarise, rank or rewrite documents |
| answer "may I write this file" (`guard`, hooks) | stop a process mid-stream |
| audit a finished round (`audit`) | roll back, stash or reset anything |
| run a brief's probes at two commits (`probe`) | write the probe or the fix |
| record escalations and verify rulings | decide a ruling, or sign one |
| configure the family to agree (`init`) | archive a brief: that is a person's decision, through spec-brief |

The agent's host runs the agent. The workflow - how to draft a brief, split a
goal, run a round, close it - is text the agent reads (skills and MCP
prompts), with a size budget a test holds (ADR-0009).

## Consequences

Every command gives the same answer for the same repository. What the plan
wanted that needs a model became prompts; what needs the host stayed the
host's.
