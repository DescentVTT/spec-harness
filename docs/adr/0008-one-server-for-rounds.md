# ADR-0008: One MCP server for rounds; spec-guard keeps its own for rules

## Decision

`spec-harness mcp` serves what is about a round: `start_round` (the context
packet), `check_path` (the guard), `request_escalation`, `audit_round`,
`list_rounds`, and the workflow prompts. spec-guard's server keeps serving the
rules (`get_architectural_rules`, `check_architecture`). The harness asks
spec-guard for rules through its command line and does not re-serve them, so
an agent meets each question once. Both servers use spec-core's `jsonrpc`
module and serve both protocol eras (spec-core ADR-0008).

*Amended 2026-10-09.* A tool refuses an argument that is given and names
nothing, as the command line refuses its option (ADR-0005): an empty `brief`
or `base`, an empty place in `paths`, an empty `recommendation`, an option
without a label (ADR-0006). The answer is a tool error that names the
argument and shows what it holds, `"paths[1]" is "", which names no file`,
and nothing is written for the call. Read as left out, an empty `brief` was
answered for the branch's brief and an empty `base` with no ruling
verified, and the agent took either for the answer to what it had asked. A
prompt's argument left empty is still the prompt alone: a client sends an
empty one for a field a person left blank.

*Amended 2026-10-11.* A `brief` that names no brief spec-brief knows, or one
it has archived, is said of the argument, as every other tool error is:
`"brief" names brief 999, and spec-brief knows no such brief`. The tool
error read `the flag names brief 999`, in the command line's words for
`--brief`, and a tool call has no flag (ADR-0004). What a tool refuses is as
it was.

*Amended 2026-10-19.* **The server reads the work tree a path is in, and
the round in the work tree its client names.** *Measured by the parent
session from the source,* and through the launcher of main (3c4112c) and of
this change with a client of this change's own (Windows 11, Node 24.18.1,
Git for Windows 2.55.0; `b25-measure-mcp.mjs`): the server opens one
workspace as it starts, from `--root` or `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, and every
tool reads the round there. In a project on `main`, whose branch names no
brief, with a worktree inside it on `claude/brief-001-w`:

| The call | main | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check_path` of the worktree's protected file, by its absolute path | tool error: no brief is named, read as the project's `.claude/worktrees/w/src/db/schema.ts` | `deny`, by the worktree's brief 001 |
| `check_path` of `src/db/schema.ts`, `start_round`, `audit_round`, the client's roots naming the worktree | tool error: no brief is named | the worktree's brief 001; `workTree` `from: "roots"` |
| the same, the client declaring no roots | tool error | the same tool error, the server's own work tree |
| `start_round` with `directory` naming the worktree | tool error: an argument it does not take | brief 001; `from: "argument"` |

Claude Code's MCP page (<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp>, *Option 3:
Add a local stdio server*, read 2026-10-19) has `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` set in
a stdio server's environment to the project root, the directory hooks
receive, "the stable project root" that does not change with the working
directories; and has Claude Code answer the protocol's `roots/list` with the
session's launch directory and every working directory granted with
`--add-dir`, `/add-dir` or `additionalDirectories`, sending
`notifications/roots/list_changed` when that set changes. It does not say
what the launch directory is in a worktree session started from the desktop
app, and no Claude Code was run to see it: the client above is this
change's own, answering as the page has Claude Code answer.

- **`check_path` decides an absolute path by the work tree of this
  repository that holds it**, as the hook decides a write (ADR-0005,
  amended the same day): the one the round is read in, another worktree,
  or the server's own, each by its own branch, briefs and configuration. A
  relative path is read from the top of the work tree the round is read
  in. A path in another repository, or in none, is decided as before.
- **The tools that read a branch read the round in one work tree**:
  `start_round`, `check_path`, `request_escalation` and `audit_round`. It is
  the one an optional `directory` argument names, a directory in the work
  tree, relative to the project or absolute; where none is given, the one
  the client's roots name, where the directories they list are in exactly
  one work tree of this repository; and the server's own otherwise, as
  before. A `directory` that is empty, is no string, or is in no work tree
  of this repository is a tool error, and nothing is read for the call.
  `list_rounds` reads no branch, and lists the server's briefs as before.
- **Roots are asked as the protocol has a server ask them**: a request of
  the server's own, `roots/list`, written where the client declared the
  `roots` capability as it started (in `initialize`, or in a later
  request's `_meta` under the newer protocol), and asked again for each
  call, since the set may change. The answer comes on the input as a
  response, which spec-core's `jsonrpc` module passes over: the server reads
  it first, by the id it asked under. A client that does not answer within
  five seconds, or answers with an error, names no roots. A root whose URI
  is not `file:` names no directory here.
- **Which work tree was read is said**: as `workTree`, its `root` and
  `from` (`argument`, `roots` or `server`), in every answer of the four
  tools, a field added beside the others; and in the answer's text, a line
  at its end, where it is not the server's own.

A call that was answered for the project is answered for the work tree
the client names, and one refused an argument now takes it: a minor
release (spec-core's ADR-0009). What was measured for this and left as it
was:

- **A client that names its roots and works elsewhere.** Where the roots
  name one work tree and a session has moved to another without adding it,
  the round is read in the one the roots name; `directory` names the other.
- **`list_rounds`** lists the server's briefs, which a worktree's branch may
  have added to.

*Amended 2026-10-24.* **`check_path` answers each path as the hook decides
a write of it.** *Claimed* by round 25's agent F: under a brief's problem
`check_path` answers the problem for a path outside every work tree of the
repository, where the hook passes it (ADR-0005, the amendment of 2026-10-19
that has such a write held by no brief). *Measured* through the launcher
of main (4227a6a) and of this change (Windows 11, Node 24.22.1, Git for
Windows 2.55.0; `b26-measure/b2.mjs`), in a project on brief 042's branch,
the brief covering `src/app/**` and protecting `src/db/**`: the hook handed
a write of each path alone, and `check_path` asked of each alone and of
all of them in one call.

| The project, and the path | The hook | `check_path` on main | Now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a brief found: the protected file, one in the scope, one outside it, the brief, a file outside every work tree | refused; passes; passes, and warns after it; passes; passes | `deny`; `allow`; `warn`; `allow`; `allow` | the same |
| the same, `outOfScope` `ask` or `deny`, the file outside the scope | asked; refused | `ask`; `deny` | the same |
| no brief named, any path | passes | tool error: `no brief is named: ...` | `allow`: `no brief governs <path>: no brief is named: ...`, as `guard` says it |
| the branch names brief 999, which spec-brief does not list, or 042, archived, or `SPEC_BRIEF=404`: a path inside | held, exit 2 | tool error, in the problem's words | `deny`, reason `held`: the problem's words, and `Next: fix the brief or the branch before writing` |
| the same, a file outside every work tree | passes | tool error | `allow`: outside the repository |
| the same, every path in one call | | tool error | each path as above |
| a brief named, spec-brief not installed: a path inside | held: `cannot check this write: spec-brief is not installed here: ...` | tool error: `spec-harness failed: spec-brief is not installed here: ...` | the same |
| the same, a file outside every work tree | passes | tool error | `allow` |
| no brief named, spec-brief not installed | passes | tool error, the same | `allow`: no brief governs it |
| a configuration that does not load | holds every write but one to the file itself | the server does not start, exit 2 | the same |

So the claim holds, and goes further: with no brief named, and with no
brief named and no spec-brief installed, `check_path` failed every call
the hook would pass, since it asked spec-brief before anything else.

- **Each path as the hook decides a write of it alone**, by the work tree
  of the repository that holds it, as before. A path outside every work
  tree of the repository, by the hook's own test (`outsideEvery`,
  `src/fs.ts`), is outside the repository, with no brief asked about
  whatever names one. The rest are decided by the brief the `brief`
  argument, `SPEC_BRIEF` or the branch names, found as the hook finds it:
  spec-brief is not asked where nothing names a brief, and is asked only
  where a path is inside.
- **A path held is refused, and says why**: `deny` with the reason `held`,
  a reason added beside the others (`heldBy`, `src/guard.ts`), in the
  hook's words for what names the brief, said of the argument where the
  argument named it (`"brief" names brief 404, ...`), with the hook's next
  step. A call that names a path inside and one outside answers each,
  where the hook holds a write of both: a call asks of each path, and an
  agent may then write the file outside alone.
- **What failed a call for a path inside fails it still**: a spec-brief
  that is not installed, cannot run or cannot list the briefs is a tool
  error, as the hook's `cannot check this write` is its exit 2; a call of
  paths that are all outside asks spec-brief nothing.
- **Its description says so**: `check_path` answers as the guard hook
  decides a write, a path held among what it refuses.
- **One table holds the two** (`tests/integration/as-the-hook.test.ts`):
  for each of nine states of a project, each of five paths is asked of the
  hook and of `check_path`, and the two answers are held to one, refused,
  asked, passed, held or not checked, in the same words.

A tool error that is now an answer, and an answer of a new reason: a minor
release (spec-core's ADR-0009). What was measured for this and left as it
was:

- **A configuration that does not load.** The server reads the project's
  configuration as it starts, and does not start, where the hook lets a
  write to the file itself through; a server that starts there and answers
  as the hook does is another change than this one.
- **`start_round`, `request_escalation` and `audit_round`** need a brief,
  and answer a tool error where none is named, as before: each acts on a
  round, not on a write.
